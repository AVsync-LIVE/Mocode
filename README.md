## Future Scope

Mocode has plans to grow and adapt to evolving web development trends. Potential future directions include support for webpack and popular UI frameworks like React. As WebContainers gain more traction, we might also add support for Node.js-based frameworks such as Express and Next.js.

## Mobile Development Philosophy

Mocode's philosophy is centered around tailoring the user experience to the mobile platform. Unlike many platforms where mobile development is an afterthought, Mocode has been designed from the ground up with mobile-first principles. Its features aim to optimize workflows on mobile devices, making tasks like copying and pasting between apps effortless. This makes Mocode ideal for developing minimum viable products (MVPs), proofs of concept, and focused tools during commutes or trips where using a full-sized laptop is impractical. Mocode truly puts the mobile development experience at the forefront.
